# Convolution Neural Network Training in C 
This is the 2nd part of my thesis work and continuation of [Convolution-Neural-Network-Training](https://github.com/gflengas/Convolution-Neural-Network-Training).

The current network for CNN training with Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is developed on C and 
trained with the MNIST data set. It consists of a Convolutional layer with 12 3Ã—3 filters 
initialized with He initialization using Relu as activation function, a Maxpool layer with pool 
size 2, and a fully connected layer using SoftMax as activation function. To measure the 
accuracy of the network, the Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss function is used. The training 
parameters that were used for the results presented are: batch size= 4, learning rate=0.01, 
momentum 0.9, decay 0.00005, epoch 20 and iterations 2000.
